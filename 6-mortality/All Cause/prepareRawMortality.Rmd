   **Outline**                                                                                               
             (A) Load the relevant libraries and import data                                                  
             (B) Create a function that imports mortality dataset and labels the columns
             (C) Loop the import function for all years of data
             (D) Change data from list to data frame
             (E) Keep only PC_CT that are in Vancouver CMA and then remove the first 5 numbers
             (F) Include only CTs and variables of interest and save file

## Load the relevant libraries and import data

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("stringr")
load(file="R:/working/preparing data/CT2011.Rdata")
load(file="R:/working/preparing data/DeathData/df_dataYear.Rdata")
CT2011<-as.matrix(CT2011)
van<-59933
```

## Create a function that imports mortality dataset and labels the columns

```{r}
import <-function(p,filename){
  setwd("R:")
  filepath = paste(p,filename,sep="")
  dat <-read.fwf(file=filepath,fill=TRUE,widths=c(8,4,2,50,3,1,1,1,1,4,2,3,1,50,25,50,3,1,2,5,100,4,2,10,10,12,12,1)) 
  colnames(dat) <-c("REGDT","DEATHDTCCYY","DEATHDTMM","DEATHCITY","DEATHPC_3","SEX","MARITAL","NATIVE","ONRESERVE","BIRTHDTCCYY","BIRTHDTMM","AGE","AGEUNITS","BIRTHCITY","OCCUPATION","CITY","PC_3","OTHER_INFO","ICD_VERSN","CAUSE","AXIS_CODES","DATAYR","VERSION","SEQNO","STUDYID","DEATHPC_6_CT","PC_CT","LINEFEED")

  dat<<-dat
  }

```

## Loop the import function for all years of data

```{r}
p <- "/DATA/2018-09-25/deaths/"
dataFiles<-list.files(path="/DATA/2018-09-25/deaths/",pattern=".B.dat.gz")

dataYear<-list()
for (x in c(1:length(dataFiles))) {
  dataYear[[x]] <- import(p,dataFiles[x])
}
```

## Change data from list to data frame

```{r}
df_dataYear <- as.data.frame(dataYear[[1]])
for (x in c(2:length(dataYear))) {
  df_dataYear <- rbind(df_dataYear, as.data.frame(dataYear[[x]]))
}
```

## Keep only PC_CT that are in Vancouver CMA and then remove the first 5 numbers

```{r}

deathsCityNoNA$CT<-str_sub(deathsCityNoNA$CT,6)
deathsCityNoNA <-transform(deathsCityNoNA, CT = 600.00)



DF_final<-rbind(deathPCCTs, missDeathCTs, deathPCretrieved)###Merged all data with residence info, death info in Van but no correct city info,and death files without residence but does have right city and death cT

## Include only CTs and variables of interest and save file

```{r}
deaths=all_data[all_data$CT %in% CT2011,]
finalMortality <-select(deaths,CT,PC_CT,DEATHPC_6_CT,DEATHDTCCYY,DEATHDTMM,SEX,MARITAL,NATIVE,BIRTHDTCCYY,AGE,BIRTHCITY,OCCUPATION,ICD_VERSN,CAUSE,AXIS_CODES,STUDYID)
